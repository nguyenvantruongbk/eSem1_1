                        <ol>
                        <li>These are the terms and conditions (“<strong>Conditions</strong>”) on which we supply products to you, whether these are goods (the “<strong>Goods</strong>”) and/or services (the “<strong>Services</strong>”) (together the “<strong>Products</strong>”).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol start="2">
                        <li>Please read these terms carefully before you submit your order to the Company. These terms tell you who we are, how we will provide Products to you, how you and we may change or end the contract, what to do if there is a problem and other important information. If you think that there is a mistake in these terms, please contact us to discuss.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol start="3">
                        <li>The Products are supplied by Supreme Imports Ltd or any of its subsidiary companies as the case may be (hereinafter referred to as the “<strong>Company</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol start="4">
                        <ol start="4">
                        <li>In some areas you will have different rights under these terms depending on whether you are a business or a consumer. You are a consumer if:
                        <ol>
                        <li>you are an individual; and</li>
                        <li>you are buying products from us wholly or mainly for your own personal use (not for use in connection with your trade, business, craft or profession).</li>
                        </ol>
                        </li>
                        </ol>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Provisions that are specific to consumers only or business customers only will be clearly marked at the beginning of such clause. If you are a consumer customer who has bought Products online, by email, telephone or fax, we would like, in particular, to draw your attention to clause 71 (short term rights of cancellation).</p>
                        <h4>QUOTATIONS AND OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU</h4>
                        <ol start="5">
                        <li>The Company may provide you with a quotation for the Products. Such quotations will be valid until the date specified on each quotation and provided it is not withdrawn by the Company prior to this date it remains capable of acceptance by you. No binding contract will come into existence between you and the Company until the Company sends to you notice of acceptance of your order (“<strong>Purchase Order</strong>”) which has either been signed by the Company’s duly authorised representative or the Company has indicated to you orally or in writing its acceptance of your order.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol start="6">
                        <li>If you place an order with the Company without requesting a quotation from the Company or before such quotation has been provided, all deliveries carried out in satisfaction of such order will be subject to these Conditions.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol start="7">
                        <li>If the Company is unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this in writing and will not charge you for the Products. This may be because the Products are out of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for, because a credit reference that we have obtained for you does not meet our minimum requirements, because we have identified an error in the price or description of the product or because we are unable to meet the delivery deadline you have specified.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol start="8">
                        <li>We will assign an order number to your order and tell you what it is when we accept your order. It will help us if you can tell us the order number whenever you contact us about your order.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4> ORDERS</h4>

                        <ol start="10">
                        <li>Where orders are sent by post or e-mail by way of confirmation of telephone instructions you will ensure they are clearly marked as such, failing which any additional expense incurred by the Company as a result of duplication of orders will be charged to you.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>CERTIFICATION</h4>

The Company may charge the market value of all samples not so returned. Such market value will be the market value on the date when the sample was due to be returned.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>COMPATIBILITY</h4>

Buyers wishing to open a credit account are requested to complete and sign an Application for Credit Account form (“<strong>Application Form</strong>”). The Proprietor(s), Partner(s) or an authorised employee (if a Limited Company), must sign the Application Form. Application forms must be submitted with the last twelve (12) months of audited accounts.

                        <h4>DELIVERY/CARRIAGE</h4>
                        <ol start="17">
                        <li>If the Product(s) are Goods we will deliver them to you as soon as reasonably possible and in any event within thirty (30) days after the date on which we accept your order (unless otherwise agreed in writing).

                        <li>Delivery dates (if any) given by the Company are given in good faith to indicate estimated delivery times but will not amount to any contractual obligation to deliver at the times stated.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol start="19">
                        <li>This clause 19 applies to business customers only. The Company will not be liable for any loss of profit, costs, damages, charges or expenses caused directly or indirectly by any delay in the delivery of the Goods (even if caused by the Company’s negligence).  If such delay continues for ninety (90) days or more, you will be entitled to terminate or rescind the contract.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <li>If our supply of Products is delayed by an event outside of our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any Products you have paid for but not received.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol start="25">
                        <li>If you do not allow us access to your property to perform the Services as arranged (and you do not have good reason for this) we may charge you additional costs incurred by us as a result.

                        <li>We may have to suspend the supply of a Product to:
                        <ol>
                        <li>deal with technical problems or make minor technical changes; and</li>

                        <li>We will contact you in advance to tell you we will be suspending supply of the Product, unless the problem is urgent or an emergency. If we have to suspend the Product for longer than ninety (90) days we will adjust the price so that you do not pay for Products while they are suspended. You may contact us to end the contract for a Product if we suspend it, or tell you we are going to suspend it, in each case for a period of more than ninety (90) days and we will refund any sums you have paid in advance for the Product in respect of the period after you end the contract.</li>

                        <li>We may also suspend the supply of Products if you do not pay. If you do not pay us for the Products when you are supposed to and you still do not make payment within fourteen (14) days of us reminding you that payment is due, we may suspend supply of the Products until you have paid us the outstanding amounts. We will contact you to tell you we are suspending supply of the Products. We will not suspend the Products where you dispute the unpaid invoice. We will not charge you for the Products during the period for which they are suspended. As well as suspending the Products we can also charge you interest on your overdue payments.</li>

Where a price per unit has been quoted and the Buyer requires a smaller number of units to be delivered than those quoted for, the Company reserves the right to adjust the rates of prices applicable thereto.</li>
