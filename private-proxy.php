                    <p><strong>Delivery:</strong> Delivery at Love4Lighting is simple. Deliveries should normally take between 2-5 working days but on some occasions the product may not be in stock which can lead to delays. It&#39;s FREE when you spend over &pound;95 and all orders under &pound;95.00 will be sent at a cost of &pound;8.39.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to collect in store for free, you can either select our Hampton or Chessington store.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>If any product within your order is out of stock and could effect the delivery time, a member of our dispatch team will notify you.</p>
                    <p><strong>International delivery: Please get in contact with us for a shipping quote.</strong></p>
